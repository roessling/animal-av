Some comments about complexity

Interpolative Search has a double (binary) logarithmic complexity
(O(log(log n)).
Finding a given element in a set of 256 elements will 
therefore take at most 3 iterations. The proof for this is too tricky
to be given here.

It is important to remember that Interpolative Search will
only work for sorted data. If the data is not fully sorted,
getting the right result depends more on luck than on the
algorithm.
